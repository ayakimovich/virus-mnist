# Virus-MNIST Readme

This repository hosts open biological dataset called Virus-MNIST. The dataset was created from superresolved Vaccinia Virus (VACV) particles micrographs obtained at Mercer Group of MRC Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology (University College London, in 2018). VACV particles were detected using in-house methodology (manuscript in preparation, stay tuned). Upon detection particles were embedded in a way to resemble the famous [MNIST]( http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset (**fig. 1**).

The Virus-MNIST dataset contains embedded images and labels split into training (117451 points) and validation (13051 points) corresponding to the individual virus particles.

The particles are labeled to mark whether they were inside (class 0, **fig. 2**) or outside (class 1, **fig. 3**) of the cell. This labeling is subject to specialist annotation.
